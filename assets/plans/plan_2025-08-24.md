SOME THOUGHTS ON PALEO LABELS

A user should be able to create manually a single label or label style and a collection of labels. A user should be able to view their labels and those others have made. This goes along for label styles as well. A user's labels and label styles should be stored in a directory on their computer in a location that can always be found. A user should be able to upload and download labels and label style files in different formats. A user should be able to modify labels and label styles. There should be different types of labels that have their own well-defined schema. There should be general labels without a schema. Labels should be able to be stored in private or public databases. Labels should have metadata that is not easily exposed to the user.

The types of labels might include: Locale, Collection, Specimen, Taxonomy, Expedition, Specimen, Specimen(s), and General. Each of the fields of these labels, which, again, have different schemas should have multiple options for the same name. For example, in Expedition the field "Location" is the same as "Place" is the same as "Locale"; a user can choose which word they like the most, but they have to choose one. Remember any names fly in the General label. Typed-labels connect to other typed-labels. A Collection label, for example, should connect to Locale, Expedition, Specimen, and Specimen labels a user has created. Specimen labels should connect to Taxonomy labels. What is printed on an actual label is but a subset of the schema.

When creating a label Paleo Labels should help the user as much as possible. Each necessary field for a non-General label or recognized (as in the user has used this field name before) field for a General label should produce a selection of previously generated fields by recency or alphabetically (order should be configurable in Settings). There should be a search function for looking up past labels to view or copy. Labels should be able to be duplicated and then edited to be a new label. Any way to make the label creation more streamline should be pursued. Users who do not want to make all their own labels should be able to batch apply new styles and modified fields across existing labels, in addition to deleting labels from a batch. For example, if you are just starting out in collecting the Pierre Shale, you should be able to a copy a label deck and then batch or individually modify the copied labels, say by making blank the locale and collector and then filling them in yourself.

Schemas for the typed-labels should be able to communicate with existing databases, such as the Paleobiology Database or iDigBio.

When a user begins using Paleo Labels, there ought to be some configuration process to match the tools to the user's preferences. This configuration file should include a Paleo Labels theme, a set of styles files, whether to include certain tabs (such as public gallery), what style to set as a default, the order of tabs for different kinds of labels, which organismal information to have in the selectbox options or autocorrect by default (e.g. mya, location, vertebrates).

A POSSIBLE APPLICATION LAYOUT

Note that "|" in this context means a separator. Everything left of the "|" is in the sidebar. Everything indented is an option in a dropdown.

MORE FEATURE INFORMATION

The default option for manual editing of styles should come from a default style file.

Multiple labels on a single sheet of PDF paper should be formatted in a way such that the borders of the labels are best aligned with each other so that someone cutting them out can cut them out in a straight line.

Newly made labels should be able to be copied N times, with each label being able to be updated individually.

The preview should be able to support viewing (scrolling through) multiple labels.

Labels should be able to be saved incomplete (e.g. with a blank line for the user to fill in).

Downloading a public deck of labels with certain labels removed and with batch modifications (all of a certain type of field blank instead of filled in) should be possible.
